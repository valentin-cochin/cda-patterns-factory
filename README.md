# Design Patterns - Case Study on Factory Method

## Purpose of the Excercise
- Discovering the different parts of the pattern.
- Showing the flexibility of the pattern.
- Testing out forks and pull-requests. 

## Steps of the exercise

### Mandatory 👶
- Fork the project (and hit the ⭐ button while you're at it). 
- Clone the project from your forked repo onto your computer.
- Create your own dev-yourName branch.
- Add a new **concrete product** named *ConsoleHello* and a **concrete creator** called *ConsoleDialog*. You should be able to display "Hello world!" in the terminal. 

> ⚠️ Please don't commit your modifications made on the *Application* class. Make the life of pull-requests easy.

### Optional 🤯
- Add your own **concrete product** (e.g., JavaFxHello, HtmlHello). Don't forget the **concrete creators**.
- Try a pull request after adding your own hello.
- After I make some changes on the main repo. Try to get my changes on your local repo.
